Activity: Infinite deck poker using VRFs. 

We implemented as simple card game with multiple draws and in the end the player with the highest score wins.

The game is played with an infinite deck of cards, where each card has its own value. 

The game is played in rounds, where each player draws a card from the deck. The player with the highest card wins the round and gets a point.

we use VRF to sign the card draw and then verify the signature to ensure the card draw is valid.
